# Emoji Picker

This project is a simple **Emoji Picker** application built in Swift. It serves as an introduction to key SwiftUI concepts and demonstrates their practical implementation.

## Features

- **Enums**: Used to organize and manage emoji data efficiently.
- **ContentView**: The main view where the emoji picker logic and UI are defined.
- **VStack**: Used to structure and layout the emoji picker interface vertically.
- **@State**: Enables user interaction by allowing emoji selection and updating the UI dynamically.
- **Displaying Emojis**: Dynamically shows emojis from an organized data structure.
- **Modifiers**: Applied to style and customize the UI components (e.g., text size, padding, color).
